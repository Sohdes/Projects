# 🧩 My Projects

This repository contains my selected academic and technical projects.

## 🧬 Project 1 — Genetic Algorithm for Function Approximation
- Developed a tree-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python to approximate mathematical functions.
- Applied the model to house price prediction using MSE for evaluation.
- Files: `Fas1.py`, `Fas2.py`, `Fas3_1.py`.

## 🎬 Project 2 — Comparison of Recommendation Algorithms
- Implemented and benchmarked ALS, SVD, and LightGCN on the MovieLens-100K dataset.
- Built an evaluation pipeline (RMSE, MAE, Precision@5, Recall@5) with reproducible code.
- Files: `report.pdf`, `Source.pdf`.
