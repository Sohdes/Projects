🧩 My Projects

This repository contains my selected academic and technical projects.

---

Project 1 — Genetic Algorithm for Function Approximation
- Developed a tree-based Genetic Algorithm (GA) in Python to approximate mathematical functions.
- Applied the model to house price prediction using MSE for evaluation.
- Files: `Fas1.py`, `Fas2.py`, `Fas3_1.py`.

---

Project 2 — Comparison of Recommendation Algorithms
- Implemented and benchmarked ALS, SVD, and LightGCN on the MovieLens-100K dataset.
- Built an evaluation pipeline (RMSE, MAE, Precision@5, Recall@5) with reproducible code.
- Files: `report.pdf`, `Source.pdf`.

---

Project 3 — Mini Compiler in C (Flex/Bison)
- Built a lexer and LALR(1) parser with operator precedence using Flex and Bison.
- Handled identifiers, numbers, and control flow constructs such as loops.
- Files: `lex.l`, `yacc.y`, `lex.yy.c`, `yacc.tab.c`, `input.txt`, `Runer.txt`.

---

Project 4 — Client–Server Messenger (Socket Programming)
- Designed and implemented a terminal-based client-server messenger using TCP sockets.
- Implemented asynchronous message handling with multithreading for real-time communication.
- Files: Client.py, Server.py

---

Project 5 — 2D Arcade Game (Python)
- Developed a **2D platformer game** using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/) Python library.  
- Implemented custom sprite animations, camera following system, sound effects, and collision detection.  
- Designed multiple tile-based levels using Tiled (`.json`) and added collectibles for scoring.  
- **Files:**  
  - `black.py` → main game file  
  - `data.zip` → contains all tilemaps, assets, and resources  
  - `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png` → gameplay previews
